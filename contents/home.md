Welcome!

## About me
- A quantum chemist by training, PhD alumnus of [Evangelista Lab](https://evangelistalab.org/) at Emory University.

- I worked on digital quantum simulation of molecules during my doctoral research, explore my dissertation ["Achieving quantum practicality via resource-efficient simulations of strongly correlated molecules on quantum computers"](https://etd.library.emory.edu/concern/etds/td96k398b?locale=it).

- I have in-depth knowledge of:
    - quantum algorithms for quantum chemical applications
    - numerical methods in molecular quantum mechanics (density functional theory, wavefunction methods)
    - statistical mechanics, free energy methods, forcefield development.

- I am a scientific software developer working on computer-aided drug discovery, with a focus on free energy calculations and crystal structure prediction.

- My favorite part of software developement is writing unit tests and doing code reviews!

- While Python is my mother tongue, I am passionate about exploring low-level programming languages (C++, Fortran, Rust, etc) to enhance the performance of Python applications.
